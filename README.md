# FIFA World Cup 2022 Twitter Analytics
A project analyzing social media data from Twitter related to the FIFA World Cup 2022 Qatar.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes social media data from Twitter related to the FIFA World Cup 2022. Using data collection and cleaning techniques, the project provides insights into trends and sentiments surrounding the event, through data analysis and visualization methods. The scope of the methods used in this project includes the methods that have been discussed in lectures throughout the semester, such as: EDA-Preprocessing & Visualization, Clustering/Classification, Textmining and NLP-Topic Modelling, Sentiment Analysis, Social Network Analysis.. The results of the analysis can provide valuable information on public opinion and social media engagement with the World Cup.

## Data Collection
The twitter data was collected using 'twint' module from python. We used "pildun" as the keyword and set the timeframe relevant to when FIFA World Cup 2022 began and obtained 20,000 tweets.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase can help standardize the data and reduce the dimensionality of the problem.
- Removing punctuation: Punctuation marks can be removed from the text data to make it easier to process.
- Tokenization: Dividing the text into smaller units, such as words or phrases.
- Removing stop words: Stop words are common words that do not provide meaningful information and can be removed to reduce the size of the data.
- Stemming and Lemmatization: These techniques are used to reduce words to their base form, which can help reduce the dimensionality of the problem and group similar words together.
- Removing URL links and user mentions: URLs and user mentions in Twitter data can be removed as they do not provide meaningful information for most text analysis tasks.

## Data Analysis
The project utilized methods such as word clouds, clustering, TF-IDF, text collocation, sentiment analysis, social network analysis, community detection and centrality. The project combines the use of Python, Orange, and Gephy to explore the data and produce meaningful results and visualizations.

## Conclusion
- Twitter users, particularly in Indonesia, tend to use more informal language when interacting on social media. This approach can be adopted by advertisers or individuals looking to build their personal brand and engage with young people. 
- In the field of copywriting, copywriters can leverage the results of social media analytics, such as collocations and word clouds, to create more engaging and effective advertising content for personal branding, especially on Twitter. This strategy can also be used by other advertisers targeting the younger generation. 
- In the field of marketing, companies can form partnerships with individuals or social media accounts that have a strong network of connections to influence their products.
